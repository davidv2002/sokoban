# sokoban
the game Sokoban made in processing 3. <br>
now with object oriented programming and a level loader, kind of. <br>
it runs at 45fps tops. spent an hour trying to fix it, could not find a way without some kind of on resized function. <br>
<br><br>note the nonOOP version is depreciated and only here as an example of how I did it without object oriented programming.
