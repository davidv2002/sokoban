# sokoban
the game Sokoban made in processing 3. <br>
now with object oriented programming and a level loader. <br>
it runs at 45fps tops. spent an hour trying to fix it, could not find a way without some kind of on resized function. <br>
<br><br>notes, the nonOOP version is depreciated and only here as an example of how I did it without object oriented programming.
<br> the OOP version will work in the processing 4 bata
