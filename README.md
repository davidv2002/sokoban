# sokoban
the game Sokoban made in processing 3. <br>
now with object oriented programming. <br>
it runs at 25fps tops. spent an hour trying to fix it, could not find a way without some kind of resized function. <br>
<br><br.note the nonOOP version is depreciated and only here as an example of how I did it without object oriented programming.
